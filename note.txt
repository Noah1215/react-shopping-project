!! What I learned !! 

1. useQuery
(https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/useQuery)
- It is a React library that handles state management by providing some hooks for updating, fetching and caching asynchronous data in React. 
- set 'key' and 'queryFn' => after fetching, all data will be contained in 'key'.

2. useMutation
(https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/useMutation)
- It is used to mutate data.
- It allows to easily perform mutations or write operations on data, such as creating, updating, or deleting records, and handles the state management and caching logic.

3. Outlet
(https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/outlet)
- An <Outlet> should be used in parent route elements to render their child route elements.
- This allows nested UI to show up when child routes are rendered.

4. createBrowserRouter
(https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-browser-router)
- It defines custom route using path, element.

5. useNavigate
(https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-navigate)
- The useNavigate hook returns a function that lets users navigate programmatically.
- i.e) navigate(`/products/${id}`)
